        my_string = """e are some solutions:
        • Sometimes a better algorithm (a stepwise solution) in Python beats an inefficient
        one in C. The greater speed of development in Python gives you more time to
        experiment with alternatives.
        • In many applications (notably, the web), a program twiddles its gossamer thumbs
        while awaiting a response from some server across a network. The CPU (central
        processing unit, the computer’s chip that does all the calculating) is barely
        involved; consequently, end-to-end times between static and dynamic programs
        will be close.
        • The standard Python interpreter is written in C and can be extended with C
        code. I discuss this a little in Chapter 19.
        • Python interpreters are becoming faster. Java was terribly slow in its infancy, and
        a lot of research and money went into speeding it up. Python is not owned by a
        corporation, so its enhancements have been more gradual. In “PyPy” on page
        444, I talk about the PyPy project and its implications.
        • You might have an extremely demanding application, and no matter what you
        do, Python doesn’t meet your needs. The usual alternatives are C, C++, and Java.
        Go (which feels like Python but performs like C) or Rust could also be worth a
        look.
        Python 2 Versus Python 3
        One medium-sized complication is that there are two versions of Python out there.
        Python 2 has been around forever and is preinstalled on Linux and Apple computers.
        It has been an excellent language, but nothing’s perfect. In computer languages, as in
        many other areas, some mistakes are cosmetic and easy to fix, whereas others are
        hard. Hard fixes are incompatible: new programs written with them will not work on
        the old Python system, and old programs written before the fix will not work on the
        new system.
        Python’s creator (Guido van Rossum) and others decided to bundle the hard fixes
        together, and introduced them as Python 3 in 2008. Python 2 is the past, and Python
        3 is the future. The final version of Python 2 is 2.7, and it will be around for while, but
        it’s the end of the line; there will be no Python 2.8. The end of Python 2 language sup‐
        port is in January of 2020. Security and other fixes will no longer be made, and many
        prominent Python packages will drop support for Python 2 by then. Operating sys‐
        tems will soon either drop Python 2 or make 3 their new default. Conversion of pop‐
        ular Python software to Python 3 had been gradual, but we’re now well past the
        tipping point. All new development will be in Python 3."""
